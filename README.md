## Why n8n?

    n8n is a workflow automation tool that excels at connecting different apps, automating tasks, and building custom logic. Its main strengths are:
    
    1) Automation Across Systems: Easily integrates Google Sheets, email, APIs, AI models, and more for powerful cross-platform automation.
    
    2) Custom Workflows: Supports complex business logic, such as syncing CRM data, handling lead generation, sending automated notifications, orchestrating IT operations, and supporting AI-powered agents.
    
    3) Self-hosting & Data Control: Allows hosting on your own server for better security and compliance, which is critical for regulated industries.
    
    4) Cost Efficient: Unlike pay-per-task competitors, n8n’s pricing is friendlier for high-volume workflows and can be used free if self-hosted.
    
    5) Flexibility for Developers: Has built-in code nodes, customizable logic, supports dynamic expressions, and can integrate custom APIs for advanced needs.

## When to use n8n:

    1) Automating repetitive business processes (e.g., report scheduling, CRM sync, AI agent orchestration).
    
    2) When you need bespoke, highly customizable workflows.
    
    3) For scenarios requiring reliable backend logic, API integration, and secure multi-app automation.

## Why Lovable?

    Lovable is a no-code/low-code platform focused on building apps and dashboards quickly, especially for non-developers:
    
    1) Dashboard & UI Builder: Makes it easy to create visually engaging dashboards, client portals, and internal tools with drag-and-drop or AI-aided design.
    
    2) Rapid Prototyping: Ideal for swiftly creating MVPs, product demos, or proof-of-concepts—transforming ideas into working interfaces in minutes rather than days.
    
    3) Empowering Non-technical Teams: Enables designers, product managers, and founders (without coding knowledge) to build multi-platform applications, dashboards, and forms.
    
    4) Full-Stack Coverage: With the ability to build both frontend and backend, Lovable handles databases, APIs, hosting/deployment—removing operational headaches for small teams.
    
    5) Fast Iteration: Great for internal tools, simple client-facing dashboards, and situations where speed and usability matter more than deep custom logic.

## When to use Lovable:

    1) Building quick visual dashboards from data (Google Sheets, APIs) for internal or client-facing use.
    
    2) Rapid prototyping for new product ideas, landing pages, and simple business apps.
    
    3) Scenarios where non-technical users need to update or customize user interfaces.

## Use Case Illustration:

    1) n8n serves as the automated backend: managing real-time data sync with Google Sheets, triggering workflow actions (like sending emails), running AI agents, and handling logic for updates and notifications.
    
    2) Lovable is used to build the client-facing dashboard: transforming Google Sheets data into a beautiful, interactive dashboard, allowing easy visualization and basic controls for the end user—without writing front-end code.
    
    3) Integration Point: Lovable dashboards interact with n8n via webhooks, enabling seamless data flow, live updates, and chat-based or workflow-driven user actions.

        d) Automate Client Email
        
        e) Confirm test emails are sent automatically when pricing or status is updated.

8) Step 6: Real-Time Data Update and Verification

        a) Test Dashboard Interactivity
        
        b) Modify Google Sheets data (e.g., adjust pricing).
        
        c) Refresh dashboard to see live updates reflected instantly.
        
        d) Verify Data Mapping
        
        e) Ensure dashboard columns accurately mirror Google Sheets fields.
        
        f) Confirm price displays in INR and the dark theme is consistently applied.
        
        g) Interact With n8n Chatbot
        
            Chatbot can answer queries (e.g., number of headshots, list of clients).
        
        h) Test data updates via chatbot requests, updates should sync automatically.
